 Back in a moment.
 Thank you, Santa.
 Could I have an apple? All I can think about. Apples. I love apples. Maybe I'm having a craving? That's new. Never had cravings before.
 Whoa. Look at that.
 Are you okay?
 Just had a fall. All the way down there, right to the library. Hell of a climb back up.
 You're soaking wet.
 I was in the swimming pool.
 You said you were in the library.
 So was the swimming pool.
 Are you a policeman?
 Why? Did you call a policeman?
 Did you come about the crack in my wall?
 Are you all right, mister?
 No, I'm fine. It's okay. This is all perfectly norm
 Who are you?
 I don't know yet. I'm still cooking. Does it scare you?
 No, it just looks a bit weird.
 No, no, no. The crack in your wall. Does it scare you?
 Yes.
 Well then, no time to lose. I'm the Doctor. Do everything I tell you, don't ask stupid questions, and don't wander off.
 Are you all right?
 Early days. Steering's a bit off.
 If you're a doctor, why does your box say Police?
 That's disgusting. What is that?
 An apple.
 Apple's rubbish. I hate apples.
 You said you loved them.
 No, no, no. I like yoghurt. Yoghurt's my favourite. Give me yoghurt.
 I hate yoghurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
 You said it was your favourite.
 New mouth. New rules. It's like eating after cleaning your teeth. Everything tastes wrong. Argh!
 What is it? What's wrong with you?
 Wrong with me? It's not my fault. Why can't you give me any decent food? You're Scottish. Fry something.
 Ah, bacon!
 Bacon. That's bacon. Are you trying to poison me?
 Ah, you see? Beans.
 Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans. Bread and butter. Now you're talking.
 And stay out!
 We've got some carrots.
 Carrots? Are you insane? No. Wait. Hang on. I know what I need. I need, I need, I need fish fingers and custard.
 Funny.
 Am I? Good. Funny's good. What's your name?
 Amelia Pond.
 Oh, that's a brilliant name. Amelia Pond. Like a name in a fairy tale. Are we in Scotland, Amelia?
 No. We had to move to England. It's rubbish.
 So what about your mum and dad, then? Are they upstairs? Thought we'd have woken them by now.
 I don't have a mum and dad. Just an aunt.
 I don't even have an aunt.
 You're lucky.
 I know. So, your aunt, where is she?
 She's out.
 And she left you all alone?
 I'm not scared.
 Course, you're not. You're not scared of anything. Box falls out of the sky, man falls out of a box, man eats fish custard, and look at you, just sitting there. So you know what I think?
 What?
 Must be a hell of a scary crack in your wall.
 You've had some cowboys in here. Not actual cowboys, though that can happen.
 I used to hate apples, so my mum put faces on them.
 She sounds good, your mum. I'll keep it for later. This wall is solid and the crack doesn't go all the way through it. So here's a thing. Where's the draught coming from?
 Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. You know what the crack is?
 What?
 It's a crack. But I'll tell you something funny. If you knocked this wall down, the crack would stay put, because the crack isn't in the wall.
 Where is it then?
 Everywhere. In everything. It's a split in the skin of the world. Two parts of space and time that should never have touched, pressed together right here in the wall of your bedroom. Sometimes, can you hear?
 A voice. Yes.
 Prisoner Zero has escaped.
 Prisoner Zero?
 Prisoner Zero has escaped. That's what I heard. What does it mean?
 Prisoner Zero has escaped.
 It means that on the other side of this wall, there's a prison and they've lost a prisoner. And you know what that means?
 What?
 You need a better wall. The only way to close the breach is to open it all the way. The forces will invert and it'll snap itself shut. Or
 What?
 You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
 Yes.
 Everything's going to be fine.
 Prisoner Zero has escaped. Prisoner Zero has escaped.
 Hello? Hello?
 What's that?
 There, you see? Told you it would close. Good as new.
 What's that thing? Was that Prisoner Zero?
 No. I think that was Prisoner Zero's guard. Whatever it was, it sent me a message. Psychic paper. Takes a lovely little message. reads Prisoner Zero has escaped. But why tell us? Unless.
 Unless what?
 Unless Prisoner Zero escaped through here. But he couldn't have. We'd know.
 It's difficult. Brand new me. Nothing works yet. But there's something I'm missing. In the corner of my eye.
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 I've got to get back in there. The engines are phasing. It's going to burn!
 But it's just a box. How can a box have engines?
 It's not a box. It's a time machine.
 What, a real one? You've got a real time machine?
 Not for much longer if I can't get her stabilised. Five minute hop into the future should do it.
 Can I come?
 Not safe in here. Not yet. Five minutes. Give me five minutes, I'll be right back.
 People always say that.
 Am I people? Do I even look like people? Trust me. I'm the Doctor.
 Geronimo!
 Amelia! Amelia, I worked out what it was. I know what I was missing! You've got to get out of there!
 Amelia? Amelia, are you all right? Are you there?
 Prisoner Zero's here. Prisoner Zero is here! Prisoner Zero is here! Do you understand me? Prisoner Zero is
 So. They all called out at once, that's what you're saying? All of them. All the coma patients. You do understand that these people are all comatose, don't you? They can't speak.
 Yes, Doctor Ramsden.
 Then why are you wasting my time?
 Because they called for you.
 Me.
 Doctor.
 Doctor. Doctor.
 Doctor. Doctor
 Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.
 White male, mid twenties, breaking and entering. Send me some back-up. I've got him restrained. Oi! You, sit still.
 Cricket bat. I'm getting cricket bat.
 You were breaking and entering.
 Well, that's much better. Brand new me. Whack on the head, just what I needed.
 Do you want to shut up now? I've got back up on the way.
 Hang on, no, wait. You're a policewoman.
 And you're breaking and entering. You see how this works?
 But what are you doing here? Where's Amelia?
 Amelia Pond?
 Yeah, Amelia. Little Scottish girl. Where is she? I promised her five minutes but the engines were phasing. I suppose I must have gone a bit far. Has something happened to her?
 Amelia Pond hasn't lived here in a long time.
 How long?
 Six months.
 No. No. No. No, I can't be six months late. I said five minutes. I promised. What happened to her? What happened to Amelia Pond?
 into radio Sarge, it's me again. Hurry it up. This guy knows something about Amelia Pond.
 I don't think they were even conscious.
 Doctor Ramsden, there is another sort of er, funny thing.
 Yes, I know. Doctor Carver told me about your conversation. We've been very patient with you, Rory. You're a good enough nurse, but for God's sake.
 I've seen them.
 These patients are under twenty four hour supervision. We know if their blood pressure changes. There is no possibility that you could have seen them wandering about the village. Why are you giving me your phone?
 It's a camera too.
 You need to take some time off, Rory. A lot of time off. Start now. Now.
 I need to speak to whoever lives in this house right now.
 I live here.
 But you're the police.
 Yes, and this is where I live. Have you got a problem with that?
 How many rooms?
 I'm sorry, what?
 On this floor. How many rooms on this floor? Count them for me now.
 Why?
 Because it will change your life.
 Five. One, two, three, four, five.
 Six.
 Six?
 Look.
 Look where?
 That's, that is not possible. How's that possible?
 There's a perception filter all round the door. Sensed it the last time I was here. Should've seen it.
 But that's a whole room. That's a whole room I've never even noticed.
 The filter stops you noticing. Something came a while ago to hide. It's still hiding, and you need to uncuff me now.
 I don't have the key. I lost it.
 How can you have lost it? Stay away from that door! Do not touch that door! Listen to me, do not open that. Why does no-one ever listen to me? Do I just have a face that nobody listens to?
 Again. My screwdriver, where is it?
 Silver thing, blue at the end. Where did it go?
 There's nothing here.
 Whatever's there stopped you seeing the room.
 What makes you think you could see it?
 Now please, just get out.
 Silver, blue at the end?
 My screwdriver, yeah.
 It's here.
 Must have rolled under the door.
 Yeah. Must have. And then it must have jumped up on the table.
 Get out of there.
 Get out of there! Get out!
 Get out of there!
 What is it? What are you doing?
 There's nothing here, but
 Corner of your eye.
 Don't try to see it. If it knows you've seen it, it will kill you. Don't look at it. Do not look.
 Get out!
 Give me that.
 Come on. What's the bad alien done to you?
 Will that door hold it?
 What's that? What's it doing?
 I don't know. Getting dressed? Run. Just go. Your back up's coming. I'll be fine.
 There is no back up.
 I heard you on the radio. You called for back up.
 I was pretending. It's a pretend radio.
 You're a policewoman.
 I'm a kissogram!
 But it's just
 No, it isn't. Look at the faces.
 What? I'm sorry, but what?
 It's all one creature. One creature disguised as two. Clever old multi-form. A bit of a rush job, though. Got the voice a bit muddled, did you? Mind you, where did you get the pattern from? You'd need a psychic link, a live feed. How did you fix that?
 Stay, boy! Her and me, we're safe. Want to know why? She sent for back up.
 I didn't send for back-up!
 I know. That was a clever lie to save our lives. Okay, yeah, no back up. And that's why we're safe. Alone, we're not a threat to you. If we had back up, you'd have to kill us.
 Attention, Prisoner Zero. The human residence is surrounded. Attention Prisoner Zero. The human residence is surrounded.
 What's that?
 Well, that would be back up. Okay, one more time. We do have back up and that's definitely why we're safe.
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Well, safe apart from, you know, incineration.
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Come on, work, work, work, come on.
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Run! Run!
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Kissogram?
 Yes, a kissogram. Work through it.
 Why'd you pretend to be a policewoman?
 You broke into my house. It was this or a French maid. What's going on? Tell me. Tell me!
 An alien convict is hiding in your spare room disguised as a man and a dog, and some other aliens are about to incinerate your house. Any questions?
 Yes.
 Me too. No, no, no, no! Don't do that, not now! It's still rebuilding. Not letting us in.
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Come on.
 No, wait, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. The shed. I destroyed that shed last time I was here. Smashed it to pieces.
 So there's a new one. Let's go.
 Yeah, but the new one's got old. It's ten years old at least. Twelve years. I'm not six months late, I'm twelve years late.
 He's coming.
 You said six months. Why did you say six months?
 We've got to go.
 This matters. This is important. Why did you say six months?
 Why did you say five minutes!
 What?
 Come on.
 What?
 Come on!
 What?
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 You're Amelia.
 And you're late.
 Amelia Pond. You're the little girl.
 I'm Amelia and you're late.
 What happened?
 Twelve years.
 You hit me with a cricket bat.
 Twelve years.
 A cricket bat.
 Twelve years and four psychiatrists.
 Four?
 I kept biting them.
 Why?
 They said you weren't real.
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated. Repeat.
 No, no, no, come on. What? We're being staked out by an ice-cream van.
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 What's that? Why are you playing that?
 It's supposed to be Claire De Lune.
 Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated. Repeat. Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Doctor, what's happening?
 Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Hello! Sorry to burst in. We're doing a special on television faults in this area. Also crimes. Let's have a look.
 I was just about to phone. It's on every channel. Oh, hello, Amy dear. Are you a policewoman now?
 Well, sometimes.
 I thought you were a nurse.
 I can be a nurse.
 Or actually a nun?
 I dabble.
 Amy, who is your friend?
 Who's Amy? You were Amelia.
 Yeah? Now I'm Amy.
 Amelia Pond. That was a great name.
 Bit fairy tale.
 I know you, don't I? I've seen you somewhere before.
 Not me. Brand new face First time on. And what sort of job's a kissogram?
 I go to parties and I kiss people. With outfits. It's a laugh.
 You were a little girl five minutes ago.
 You're worse than my aunt.
 I'm the Doctor. I'm worse than everybody's aunt. And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
 Repetez. Le Prisonnier. Zero wird der menschliche.
 Okay, so it's everywhere, in every language. They're broadcasting to the whole world.
 What's up there? What are you looking for?
 Okay. Planet this size, two poles, your basic molten core? They're going to need a forty percent fission blast.
 But they'll have to power up first, won't they? So assuming a medium sized starship, that's 20 minutes. What do you think, twenty minutes? Yeah, twenty minutes. We've got twenty minutes.
 Twenty minutes to what?
 Are you the Doctor?
 He is, isn't he? He's the Doctor! The Raggedy Doctor. All those cartoons you did when you were little. The Raggedy Doctor. It's him.
 sotto Shut up.
 Cartoons?
 Gran, it's him, isn't it? It's really him!
 Jeff, shut up. Twenty minutes to what?
 The human residence will be incinerated. Repeat.
 The human residence. They're not talking about your house, they're talking about the planet. Somewhere up there, there's a spaceship, and it's going to incinerate the planet.
 will be incinerated. Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Twenty minutes to the end of the world.
 Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate 'the human residence, or the human residence will be incinerated.
 Repeat. Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated.
 What is this place? Where am I?
 Leadworth.
 Where's the rest of it?
 This is it.
 Is there an airport?
 No.
 A nuclear power station?
 No.
 Even a little one?
 No.
 Nearest city?
 Gloucester. Half an hour by car.
 We don't have half an hour. Do we have a car?
 No.
 Well, that's good. Fantastic, that is. Twenty minutes to save the world and I've got a post office. And it's shut. What is that?
 It's a duck pond.
 Why aren't there any ducks?
 I don't know. There's never any ducks.
 Then how do you know it's a duck pond?
 It just is. Is it important, the duck pond?
 I don't know. Why would I know? This is too soon. I'm not ready, I'm not done yet.
 What's happening? Why's it going dark?
 So what's wrong with the sun?
 Nothing. You're looking at it through a forcefield. They've sealed off your upper atmosphere. Now they're getting ready to boil the planet. Oh, and here they come. The human race. The end comes, as it was always going to, down a video phone.
 This isn't real, is it? This is some kind of big wind up.
 Why would I wind you up?
 You told me you had a time machine.
 And you believed me.
 Then I grew up.
 Oh, you never want to do that. No. Hang on. Shut up. Wait. I missed it. I saw it and I missed it. What did I see? I saw. What did I see? I saw, I saw, I saw
30
 Twenty minutes. I can do it. Twenty minutes, the planet burns. Run to your loved ones and say goodbye, or stay and help me.
 No.
 I'm sorry?
 No!
 Amy, no, no, what are you doing?
 Are you out of your mind?
 Who are you?
 You know who I am.
 No, really. Who are you?
 Look at the sky. End of the world, twenty minutes.
 Well, better talk quickly, then.
 Amy, I am going to need my car back.
 Yes, in a bit. Now go and have coffee.
 Right, yes.
 Catch.
 I'm the Doctor. I'm a time traveller. Everything I told you twelve years ago is true. I'm real. What's happening in the sky is real, and if you don't let me go right now, everything you've ever known is over.
 I don't believe you.
 Just twenty minutes. Just believe me for twenty minutes. Look at it. Fresh as the day you gave it to me. And you know it's the same one. Amy, believe for twenty minutes.
 What do we do?
 Stop that nurse.
 The sun's going out, and you're photographing a man and a dog. Why?
 Amy.
 Hi! Oh, this is Rory, he's a friend.
 Boyfriend.
 Kind of boyfriend.
 Amy.
 Man and dog. Why?
 Oh my God, it's him.
 Just answer his question, please.
 It's him, though. The Doctor. The Raggedy Doctor.
 Yeah, he came back.
 But he was a story. He was a game.
 Man and dog. Why? Tell me now.
 Sorry. Because he can't be there. Because he's
 In a hospital, in a coma.
 Yeah.
 Knew it. Multiform, you see? Disguise itself as anything, but it needs a life feed. A psychic link with a living but dormant mind.
 Prisoner Zero.
 What? There's a Prisoner Zero too?
 Yes.
 See, that ship up there is scanning this area for non-terrestrial technology. And nothing says non-terrestrial like a sonic screwdriver.
 Oi, come back here! Come back!
 I think someone's going to notice, don't you?
 No, no! No, don't do that!
 Look, it's going.
 No, come back. He's here! Come back! He's here. Prisoner Zero is here. Come back, he's here! Prisoner Zero is
 Doctor! The drain. It just sort of melted and went down the drain.
 Well, of course it did.
 What do we do now?
 It's hiding in human form. We need to drive it into the open. No Tardis, no screwdriver, seventeen minutes. Come on, think. Think!
 Barney? Barney? Barney? Can you hear me, Barney? Barney? Barney?
 So that thing, that hid in my house for twelve years?
 Multiforms can live for millennia. Twelve years is a pit-stop.
 So how come you show up again on the same day that lot do? The same minute!
 They're looking for him, but they followed me. They saw me through the crack, got a fix, they're only late because I am.
 What's he on about?
 Nurse boy, give me your phone.
 How can he be real? He was never real.
 Phone. Now. Give me.
 He was just a game. We were kids. You made me dress up as him.
 These photos, they're are all coma patients?
 Yeah.
 No, they're all the multiform. Eight comas, eight disguises for Prisoner Zero.
 He had a dog, though. There's a dog in a coma?
 Well, the coma patient dreams he's walking a dog, Prisoner Zero gets a dog. Laptop! Your friend, what was his name? Not him, the good-looking one.
 Thanks.
 Jeff.
 Oh, thanks.
 He had a laptop in his bag. A laptop. Big bag, big laptop. I need Jeff's laptop. You two, get to the hospital. Get everyone out of that ward. Clear the whole floor. Phone me when you're done.
 Your car. Come on.
 But how can he be here? How can the Doctor be here?
 Hello. Laptop. Give me.
 No, no, no, no, wait.
 It's fine. Give it here.
 Hang on!
 Blimey. Get a girlfriend, Jeff.
 Gran.
 What are you doing?
 The sun's gone wibbly, so right now, somewhere out there, there's going to be a big old video conference call. All the experts in the world panicking at once, and do you know what they need? Me. Ah, and here they all are. All the big boys. NASA, Jodrell Bank, Tokyo Space Centre, Patrick Moore.
 I like Patrick Moore.
 I'll get you his number. But watch him, he's a devil.
 You can't just hack in on a call like that.
 Can't I?
 Who are you?
 This is a secure call, what are you doing here?
 Hello. Yeah, I know you should switch me off, but before you do, watch this.
 It's here too, I'm getting it.
 Fermat's Theorem, the proof. And I mean the real one. Never been seen before. Poor old Fermat, got killed in a duel before he could write it down. My fault. I slept in. Oh, and here's an oldie but a goodie. Why electrons have mass. And a personal favourite of mine, faster than light travel with two diagrams and a joke. Look at your screens. Whoever I am, I'm a genius. Look at the sun. You need all the help you can get. Fellas, pay attention.
 Sir, what are you doing?
 I'm writing a computer virus. Very clever, super fast, and a tiny bit alive, but don't let on. And why am I writing it on a phone? Never mind, you'll find out. Okay, I'm sending this to all your computers. Get everyone who works for you sending this everywhere. Email, text, Facebook, Bebo, Twitter, radar dish, whatever you've got. Any questions?
 Who was your lady friend?
 Patrick, behave.
 What does this virus do?
 It's a reset command, that's all. It resets counters. It gets in the wifi and resets every counter it can find. Clocks, calendars, anything with a chip will default at zero at exactly the same time. But yeah, I could be lying, why should you trust me? I'll let my best man explain. sotto Jeff, you're my best man.
 You what?
 Listen to me. In ten minutes, you're going to be a legend. In ten minutes, everyone on that screen is going to be offering you any job you want. But first, you have to be magnificent. You have to make them trust you and get them working. This is it, Jeff, right here, right now. This is when you fly. Today's the day you save the world.
 Why me?
 It's your bedroom. Now go, go, go.
 Okay, guys, let's do this.
 Oh, and delete your internet history.
 Something's happened up there. We can't get through.
 I'm phoning him. Doctor? We're at the hospital, but we can't get through.
 What did he say?
 Look in the mirror. Ha ha! Uniform. Are you on your way? You're going to need a car.
 Don't worry, I've commandeered a vehicle.
 Oh god.
 Officer.
 What happened?
 There was a man. A man with a dog. I think Doctor Ramsden's dead. And the nurses.
 Are you in?
 Yep.
 But so's Prisoner Zero.
 You need to get out of there.
 He was so angry. He kept shouting and shouting. And that dog. The size of that dog.
 I swear it was rabid. And he just went mad, attacking everyone.
 Where did he go, did you see? Has he gone? We hid in the ladies.
 Oh, I'm getting it wrong again, aren't I? I'm always doing that. So many mouths.
 Oh, my God!
 Amy? Amy, what's happening?
 Amy, talk to me!
 We're in the coma ward, but it's here. It's getting in.
 Which window are you?
 What, sorry?
 Which window?
 First floor, on the left, fourth from the end.
 Oh, dear little Amelia Pond. I've watched you grow up. Twelve years, and you never even knew I was there. Little Amelia Pond, waiting for her magic Doctor to return. But not this time, Amelia.
 Right! Hello. Am I late? No, three minutes to go. So still time.
 Time for what, Time Lord?
 Take the disguise off. They'll find you in a heartbeat. Nobody dies.
 The Atraxi will kill me this time. If I am to die, let there be fire.
 Okay. You came to this world by opening a crack in space and time. Do it again. Just leave.
 I did not open the crack.
 The cracks in the skin of the universe, don't you know where they came from? You don't, do you?
 The Doctor in the Tardis doesn't know. Doesn't know. Doesn't know!
 The universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall.
 And we're off! Look at that. Look at that!
00.
 Oh! And I think they just found us!
 The Atraxi are limited. While I'm in this form, they'll still be unable to detect me. They've tracked a phone, not me.
 Yeah, but this is the good bit. I mean, this is my favourite bit. Do you know what this phone is full of? Pictures of you. Every form you've learned to take, right here. Ooo, and being uploaded about now. And the final score is, no Tardis, no screwdriver, two minutes to spare. Who da man? Oh, I'm never saying that again. Fine.
 Then I shall take a new form.
 Oh, stop it. You know you can't. It takes months to form that kind of psychic link.
 And I've had years.
 No! Amy? You've got to hold on. Amy? Don't sleep! You've got to stay awake, please.
 Doctor.
 Well, that's rubbish. Who's that supposed to be?
 It's you.
 You don't know?
 Busy day. Why me, though? You're linked with her. Why are you copying me?
 I'm not. Poor Amy Pond. Still such a child inside. Dreaming of the magic Doctor she knows will return to save her. What a disappointment you've been.
 No, she's dreaming about me because she can hear me. Amy, don't just hear me, listen. Remember the room, the room in your house you couldn't see. Remember you went inside. I tried to stop, but you did. You went in the room. You went inside. Amy, dream about what you saw.
 No. No. No!
 Well done, Prisoner Zero. A perfect impersonation of yourself.
 Prisoner Zero is located. Prisoner Zero is restrained.
 Silence, Doctor. Silence will fall.
 The sun. It's back to normal, right? That's, that's good, yeah? That means it's over.
 Amy. Are you okay? Are you with us?
 What happened?
 He did it. The Doctor did it.
 No, I didn't.
 What are you doing?
 Tracking the signal back. Sorry in advance.
 About what?
 The bill.
 Oi, I didn't say you could go! Article fifty seven of the Shadow Proclamation. This is a fully established level five planet, and you were going to burn it? What? Did you think no-one was watching? You lot, back here, now. Okay, now I've done it.
 Did he just bring them back? Did he just save the world from aliens and then bring all the aliens back again?
 Where are you going?
 The roof. No, hang on.
 I'm saving the world - I need a decent shirt. To hell with the raggedy. Time to put on a show.
 You just summoned aliens back to Earth. Actual aliens, deadly aliens, aliens of death, and now you're taking your clothes off. Amy, he's taking his clothes off.
 Turn your back if it embarrasses you.
 Are you stealing clothes now? Those clothes belong to people, you know. to Amy Are you not going to turn your back?
 No.
 So this was a good idea, was it? They were leaving.
 Leaving is good. Never coming back is better. Come on, then! The Doctor will see you now.
 You are not of this world.
 No, but I've put a lot of work into it.
 Oh, hmm, I don't know. What do you think?
 Is this world important?
 Important? What's that mean, important? Six billion people live here. Is that important? Here's a better question. Is this world a threat to the Atraxi? Well, come on. You're monitoring the whole planet. Is this world a threat?
 No.
 Are the peoples of this world guilty of any crime by the laws of the Atraxi?
 No.
 Okay. One more. Just one. Is this world protected? Because you're not the first lot to come here. Oh, there have been so many.
 And what you've got to ask is, what happened to them?
 Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically, run.
 Is that it? Is that them gone for good? Who were they?
 Okay, what have you got for me this time?
 Look at you. Oh, you sexy thing! Look at you.
 Sorry about running off earlier. Brand new Tardis. Bit exciting. Just had a quick hop to the moon and back to run her in. She's ready for the big stuff now.
 It's you. You came back.
 Course I came back. I always come back. Something wrong with that?
 And you kept the clothes.
 Well, I just saved the world. The whole planet, for about the millionth time, no charge. Yeah, shoot me. I kept the clothes.
 Including the bow tie.
 Yeah, it's cool. Bow ties are cool.
 Are you from another planet?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So what do you think?
 Of what?
 Other planets. Want to check some out?
 What does that mean?
 It means. Well, it means come with me.
 Where?
 Wherever you like.
 All that stuff that happened. The hospital, the spaceships, Prisoner Zero.
 Oh, don't worry, that's just the beginning. There's loads more.
 Yeah, but those things, those amazing things, all that stuff. That was two years ago.
 Oh.! Oops.
 Yeah.
 So that's
 Fourteen years!
 Fourteen years since fish custard. Amy Pond, the girl who waited, you've waited long enough.
 When I was a kid, you said there was a swimming pool and a library, and the swimming pool was in the library.
 Yeah. Not sure where it's got to now. It'll turn up. So, coming?
 No.
 You wanted to come fourteen years ago.
 I grew up.
 Don't worry. I'll soon fix that.
 Well? Anything you want to say? Any passing remarks? I've heard them all.
 I'm in my nightie.
 Oh, don't worry. Plenty of clothes in the wardrobe. And possibly a swimming pool. So, all of time and space, everything that ever happened or ever will Where do you want to start?
 You are so sure that I'm coming.
 Yeah, I am.
 Why?
 Cause you're the Scottish girl in the English village, and I know how that feels.
 Oh, do you?
 All these years living here, most of your life, and you've still got that accent. Yeah, you're coming.
 Can you get me back for tomorrow morning?
 It's a time machine. I can get you back five minutes ago. Why, what's tomorrow?
 Nothing. Nothing. Just you know, stuff.
 All right, then. Back in time for stuff.
 Oh! A new one! Lovely. Thanks, dear.
 Why me?
 Why not?
 No, seriously. You are asking me to run away with you in the middle of the night. It's a fair question. Why me?
 I don't know. Fun. Do I have to have a reason?
 People always have a reason.
 Do I look like people?
 Been knocking around on my own for a while. My choice, but I've started talking to myself all the time. It's giving me earache.
 You're lonely. That's it? Just that?
 Just that. Promise.
 Okay.
 So, are you okay, then? Because this place, sometimes it can make people feel a bit, you know.
 I'm fine. It's just, there's a whole world in here, just like you said. It's all true. I thought. Well, I started to think that maybe you were just like a madman with a box.
 Amy Pond, there's something you'd better understand about me, because it's important, and one day your life may depend on it. I am definitely a madman with a box. Ha ha! Yeah. Goodbye Leadworth, hello everything.
